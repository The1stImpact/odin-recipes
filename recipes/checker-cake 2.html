<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol class="instructions">
    <li>Preparation: Preheat oven to 175 degrees C(350 degrees F) and make sure the racks are in middle and lower third positions.</li>
    <li>Put devils food cake mix, 1 cup milk, 1/3 cup melted butter, 3 large eggs and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract into bowl of stand mixer. Beat at low speeds using paddle for 1 minute until combined.Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Spoon batter evenly into 2 (9-inch) round nonstick cake pans, greased with baking spray; set aside. Repeat procedure with the white cake mix, substituting 3 egg whites for 3 large eggs.</li>
    <li>Bake 4 cakes in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in middle comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating cake pans from front to back and between top and bottom racks halfway through baking time. Remove pans to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans and cool completely on wire racks, about 1 hour. Trim the top of the cakes as needed to make sure the top is level.</li>
    <li>Prepare frosting: Beat softened butter with a stand mixer at medium speed, using the paddle attachment, until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add softened cream cheese and mix for 1 minute until combined, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Whisk together powdered sugar and cocoa in a large bowl; gradually add to butter mixture alternately with 4 tablespoons milk, along with the vanilla. Beat at low speed until blended after each addition, stopping to scrape down bowl in between additions. (If needed, add up to 1 tablespoon milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, to reach desired consistency.) Increase speed to medium, and beat 1 to 2 minutes or until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Assemble cake: Place 1 chocolate cake layer on a cutting board. Using a 6-inch round cutter, cut out center of cake to create a 6-inch cake round; leave 9-inch cake ring intact, and remove center 6-inch cake. Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut out center of the 6-inch cake to create a 3-inch cake round; leave 6-inch ring intact, and remove center 3-inch cake round. Place the 9-inch cake ring on a serving platter or cake stand. Set aside 6-inch ring and 3-inch cake round.</li>
    <li>Repeat process with 1 vanilla cake layer to create 1 (9-inch) vanilla cake ring, 1 (6-inch) vanilla cake ring, and 1 (3-inch) vanilla cake round.</li>
    <li>Place the 6-inch vanilla ring in the center of the 9-inch chocolate ring. Place the 3-inch chocolate cake round in the center of the 6-inch vanilla ring. Spread a thin layer of frosting over layer on platter. Place 9-inch vanilla cake ring on frosted layer and place the 6-inch chocolate ring in center of thee 9-inch vanilla ring. Place the 3-inch vanilla cake round in the center of the 6-inch chocolate ring. Spread a thin layer of frosting over layer. Repeat process with remaining chocolate cake layer and vanilla cake layer.
